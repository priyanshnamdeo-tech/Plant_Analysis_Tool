📖 Project Description

The Plant Analysis Tool is a web-based application that uses Generative AI to analyze plant images and provide meaningful insights. Users can upload an image of a plant, and the system identifies the plant, analyzes its health condition, detects possible diseases, and suggests suitable plant-care recommendations such as watering, sunlight, and soil requirements.

This project demonstrates the practical application of GenAI in solving real-world problems, especially in the domain of agriculture and plant care.
